# D3-Challenge


## Background
Welcome to the newsroom! You've just accepted a data visualization position for a major metro paper. You're tasked with analyzing the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand your findings.
The editor wants to run a series of feature stories about the health risks facing particular demographics. She's counting on you to sniff out the first story idea by sifting through information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.
The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau, but you are free to investigate a different data set. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

## Assignment
You need to create a scatter plot between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.
Using the D3 techniques we taught you in class, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the app.js file of your homework directory—make sure you pull in the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. 

* Include state abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

## Key Points

* Income is strongly associated with morbidity and mortality across the income distribution, and income-related health disparities appear to be growing over time.

* Income influences health and longevity through various clinical, behavioral, social, and environmental mechanisms. Isolating the unique contribution of income to health can be difficult because this relationship intersects with many other social risk factors.

* Poor health also contributes to reduced income, creating a negative feedback loop sometimes referred to as the health-poverty trap.

* Income inequality has grown substantially in recent decades, which may perpetuate or exacerbate health disparities.

* Policy initiatives that supplement income and improve educational opportunities, housing prospects, and social mobility—particularly in childhood—can reduce poverty and lead to downstream health effects not only for low-income people but also for those in the middle class.
